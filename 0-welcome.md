# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Hi, welcome to my data structure tutorial! Here we will go over three different data structures- Queues, Linked Lists, and Trees. 

Each page will have instructional material, some example code, and a problem for you to solve with a possible solution available. 

This tutorial was made for users that already have some previous experience programming in python. We recommend spending at max one hour on the coding problem for each data structure before checking the solution.
